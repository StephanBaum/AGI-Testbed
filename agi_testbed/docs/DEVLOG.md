# Development Log for AGI Testbed

## 2025-03-24: Project Initialization

- Created basic project structure
  - Set up src, docs, and ui directories
  - Created README.md with installation instructions
  - Initialized development log
- Planned initial implementation of the AGI testbed components

### Current Status
- Project structure set up
- Documentation initialized
- Ready to begin Rust implementation

### Next Steps
- Initialize Rust project using Cargo
- Implement base structure for Core Orchestrator
- Create scaffolding for the four main component instances
- Begin implementation of web interface for monitoring and control

### Challenges Identified
- Need to establish proper communication patterns between components
- Must determine appropriate data structures for memory management
- Need to define metrics and logging format for observability

## 2025-03-24: Component Implementation

- Created Core Orchestrator module
  - Implemented component registration and management
  - Added messaging and task submission functionality
  - Created metrics collection framework
- Implemented four main component instances:
  - Variable Time-Scaling Instance
  - Continuous Memory Management Instance
  - Inference-Based Reasoning Instance
  - Persistent Operational State Instance
- Each component implements the shared Component trait
- Set up intercomponent communication patterns

### Current Status
- Core orchestrator and component interfaces implemented
- Component-specific functionality in place
- Base communication patterns established
- Component metrics collection system implemented

### Next Steps
- Create web interface for monitoring and control
- Implement testbed scenarios
- Add more comprehensive testing
- Enhance metrics visualization

## 2025-03-24: Web Interface Implementation

- Created web server using Actix-Web
  - Implemented API endpoints for all components
  - Created handlers for system status and control
  - Added testbed execution endpoints
- Designed user interface
  - Created responsive layout with CSS
  - Implemented component monitoring dashboards
  - Added testbed execution and monitoring UI
  - Built interactive controls for components
- Added JavaScript for frontend interactivity
  - Real-time updates of component status
  - Interactive controls for running experiments
  - Visualizations for component metrics

### Current Status
- Web interface structure in place
- API endpoints implemented for all components
- Basic UI templates created
- Dashboard for system monitoring implemented

### Next Steps
- Add more advanced visualizations for metrics
- Implement more detailed component control interfaces
- Add comprehensive documentation to the UI
- Create tutorials for running specific experiments
- Fine-tune component implementations
